    You arrive at the old mansion just as night begins to fall. A murder has been committed, and your job is to solve the case.
    The mansion is eerie, with creaking floorboards and the scent of aged wood filling the air. The room where the murder happened is locked,
    but there are three key locations you can investigate: the living room, the study, and the garden.
    You must decide where to go first.
